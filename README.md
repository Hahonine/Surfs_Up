## Summary
- There is never a bad time to visit Hawaii. The temperature is always between a slightly chilly mid 50's and a slightly hot mid 80's.

- To gather more specific data I would write a query to pull data from specific stations on the island you intend to visit, localizing the results to where you intend to be.

- A fianl query worth exploring would be one that analyses the weather trends in the months preceding and proceding June and December to see if it's better to plan your trip for the start of the month, or for the end of the month (or for the middle of the month).
